## What the package sends as a notification

- Last route the user visited
- If they are authenticated or not
- User ID (If user is authenticated)
- User email (If user is authenticated)
- User error description message (After form is submitted, for a non view based App)
- File Error (The actual file the error was associated with)
- Line Number (The line number the error happened)
- Trace error (The list of files associated with the error; *before and after form is submitted*)


## How to install

```
composer require jgodstime/laravel-error-notifier

```

In your */app/Exceptions/Handler.php* file, in the register method, add `\ErrorNotifier\Notify\Helper::getError($e);` this must be  inside  reportable callback

```php
    public function register()
    {
    	$this->reportable(function (Throwable  $e)  {
    		 \ErrorNotifier\Notify\Helper::getError($e);
    	});
    }

```

## Disable  Instant Notification 
 
By default this package sends notification immediately the error occured i.e without waiting for users description of the error, you can disable this by adding `NOTIFIER_INSTANT=false` in your .env file
 
### Publishing the vendor files

By default, Laravel displays the 500 error page in your */views/errors/500.blade.php* file when a 500 error occurs in your application

This package places the 500.blade.php file in the */views/errors/* folder after you publish the vendor file

If you already have a 500.blade.php file in your */views/errors* folder and you want to use this package; you should remove or move it to another folder.

### Publish the vendor files if your app is not API 

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="ErrorNotifier\Notify\ErrorNotifierServiceProvider"
```

*Now the vendor files are published in their respective paths*

## Let's Test

### Setup your email driver
> To setup your email driver, you can use [mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) for test purpose.

```
    MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
    MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
    MAIL_PORT=587
    MAIL_USERNAME=528a733...
    MAIL_PASSWORD=73c29...
    MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
    MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=mygoogle@gmail.com
    MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```
### Disable notification to email
> To disable notification to email, set `NOTIFIER_EMAIL=` in your .env file


### Add your slack webhook (Optional)
> To setup your  [slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)  webhook url

``` 
LOG_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/T....

```

### We are good ðŸ˜Š 
To test this, simply add `$array['key1'] = 'john'; $data  = $array['key2'];` in one of your routes, then hit the route In your browser.

```php
    Route::get('/convert/file', function(){
    	 $array['key1'] = 'john';
        $data  = $array['key2'];
    });
```

Notice that we are trying to access an array with key2 that doesnâ€™t exist, this will throw an error and the package will send the error as notification to your email as well as the trace.

Also, you must turn `APP_DEBUG=false` and `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your .env file

**You should see this**

 If you donâ€™t  have `NOTIFIER_INSTANT=false` in your .env file, the package sends instant notification to the setup email and slack channel

Also, after user submits the form, the package sends another notification with user error description message.

### Modify Page Design
You can modify the style for the page to suit your taste,
>  **Note:** Be careful not to change the **form route** and **hidden inputs**.

A notification email is sent to the email specified in the laravel environment variable (`MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`) in your *.env* file

You can change this by adding `NOTIFIER_EMAIL="hello@example.com"` in your .env file.


### Send Email to Multiple Recipients

You can send notification to multiple recipients by adding multiple emails as a string in comma separated format without space

```
NOTIFIER_EMAIL="hello1@example.com,hello2@example.com"
```

### Change Redirect Page URL

You can change the page user is taken to after submitting the form, by default it goes to the home page (/)

    NOTIFIER_REDIRECT_URL='/thank-you'
